# Dreda for Google Cardboard
This is derived from [this older project](https://github.com/metasyn/dreda) by quickly hacking together the following:
* no UI, it simply loads a static .json file
* support for Google Cardboard

Please refer to the original project. This is still work in progress.

## Instructions:
1. Clone it
2. `python -m SimpleHTTPSever` or `python -m http.server 8000`
3. Then, http://localhost:8000
